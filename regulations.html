                <a id="regtext">The double-diffuser concept is banned, with teams requiring the use of simple, single-piece diffusers. The "F-duct" system pioneered by McLaren is banned (in conjunction with banning shark fins from being connected to the rear wing). Adjustable front wings have also been banned. Gearboxes must last for 5 race weekends, but for the season each driver has one penalty free (a.k.a. a "joker") gearbox change at their disposal. Driver adjustable rear wing, known as DRS (drag reduction system) introduced to help overtaking. Can be freely used in practice and qualifying, but in the race only when within 1 second of the next car by the detection zone, and only activated in the activation zone. DRS wing must immediately close under braking, and DRS is de-activated in the first 2 laps of each race, plus when a track is declared wet. 107% qualifying rule re-introduced following concerns about new teams pace. Teams agree to re-introduce KERS, with minimum car weight increasing by twenty kilograms to offset the weight of the KERS device. Sporting regulations amended to clear up last-lap safety car and qualifying in-lap procedures.[60] Drivers are also warned to be examples of road safety when driving in public following Lewis Hamilton being pulled over following the 2010 Australian Grand Prix; FIA President Jean Todt suggests a policy similar to the NFL Personal Conduct code for suspension or revocation of racing licences. Ban on team orders lifted (although FIA can use disrepute clause for misuse of it).</a>

                <a id="regtext">Teams will be allowed to use one more MGU-K compared to 2019 to compensate for the increased demands of contesting twenty-two races.
                    Drivers who participate in free practice sessions will be eligible for additional FIA Super Licence points. Any driver who completes a minimum 100 km (62 mi) during a free practice session will receive an additional Super Licence point on the condition that they do not commit a driving infraction. Drivers may only accrue ten Super Licence points per year from free practice sessions.
                    As a result of the expanded calendar, the two pre-season tests due to take place at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya will be reduced in length from four days to three days each, whilst the two in-season tests that took place at Bahrain International Circuit and Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in 2019 have been discontinued. Teams will also no longer be allowed to hide their cars during testing. The amount of time in which car mechanics are not allowed to work on the car has been extended from eight to nine hours.
                    The rules surrounding jump starts and the weighbridge have been relaxed with the race stewards now being able to hand out less severe punishments for missing the weighbridge and jump starts.The Chinese Grand Prix was originally due to take place on 19 April but was postponed because of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. Ferrari and AlphaTauri expressed concern as both teams are based in Italy, which has suffered one of the worst outbreaks of the virus outside China.</a>

                <a id="regtext">Discussions over the 2021 engine regulations began in 2017 and were finalised in May 2018. The proposed regulations involved removing the Motor Generator Unitâ€“Heat (MGU-H) to simplify the technology used in the engine whilst raising the maximum rev limit by 3000 rpm. Further proposals dubbed "plug-and-play" would see engine suppliers bound by the regulations to make individual engine components universally compatible, allowing teams to source their components from multiple suppliers. The proposals were designed to simplify the engine technology whilst making the sport more attractive to new entrants. However, as no new power unit suppliers committed themselves to entering the sport from 2021, the existing suppliers proposed to retain the existing power unit formula in a bid to reduce overall development costs with a similar restriction to teams in regards to commercially available materials.
                    The quota system of power unit components will continue in 2021, with teams given a limited number of individual components that can be used before incurring a penalty. The exhaust system will be added to the list of components, with teams allowed to use a maximum of six over the course of the championship. The championship is due to introduce a budget cap, with teams limited to spending a maximum of $175 million per year, with teams being required to use more commercially available materials and teams must submit their annual expenditure. The value is set for twenty-one races.</a>
